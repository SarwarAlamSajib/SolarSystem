Our solar system is a planetary system that orbits a star we call the Sun and everything that travels around it â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and few more, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. 
<br/><br/>The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the vast Milky Way galaxy. It consists of the Sun (our star) and everything that orbits around it. This includes the eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon), dwarf planets and their satellites, as well as asteroids, comets and countless particles of smaller debris.
</br><br/>Most stars host their own planets, so there are likely tens of billions of other solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy alone. We've discovered thousands of planetary systems around other stars.
<br/><br/>There are 8 planets in our solar system. They are listed below,
